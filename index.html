		<div class="container-1">
			<div class="section">
				<h2>Education</h2>
				<p>From people’s minds to market trends,
					To learning how the code extends —
					Sociology, marketing, AI combined,
					A curious path, sharply defined.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h2>Experience</h2>
				<p>From healthcare code to pharma labs,
					I tested truth in every tab.
					With scripts I wrote and bugs I chased,
					In agile teams, no time to waste.

					I taught, I learned, I led with care,
					Brought structure, insight, QA flair.
					From audits strict to browsers wide,
					In every spec, I took deep pride.

					Each role I grew, each skill I earned —
					A craft of quality, self-taught and learned.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section">
				<h2>Skills</h2>
				<p>I lead, I test, I break, I teach,
					From audits deep to APIs’ reach.
					Accessibility, standards, secure design —
					Quality’s more than just a line.

					Self-taught, adaptive, always aware,
					I build what’s missing, with skill and care.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Test with care and skills to share</li>
					<li>Teach and guide with steady stride</li>
					<li>Spot what's wrong and make it strong</li>
				</ul>
